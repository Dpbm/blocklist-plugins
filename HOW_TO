# How to start creating

1. add a file for each list you want to add. So if you want to add 3 lists of `drugs`, `scam` and `porn`, create three files with these names:

```bash
drugs
scam
porn
```

`Note: Don't put especial characters, it'll break the script to download the file.` \

2. inside of each file, you need to put the url to download the list file (put just one line with the URL) \

3. modify the [readme](./readme.md) file with your plugin data \

4. delete this file \

5. to finish, just upload this repo to your github account :)
